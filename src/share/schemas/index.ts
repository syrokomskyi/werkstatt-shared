<MODULE_CONTRACT>
<purpose>
RFC-0264: barrel for the entire @warpgogol/werkstatt-shared/share schemas domain — base page schema,
navigation, feature policy, and the RFC-0101..0106/0202/0210/0220/0231/0257
canonical section-visual / section-content / media / material-credit / print
contracts. Consumers should prefer `@warpgogol/werkstatt-shared/share/schemas` over the deprecated
root barrel.
</purpose>
<non-goals>
  <item>Do not contain schema definitions — pure re-export barrel.</item>
</non-goals>

<CHANGE_SUMMARY>
  <item>RFC-0264: initial creation — aggregates the schemas/ domain for the @warpgogol/werkstatt-shared/share/schemas subpath.</item>
