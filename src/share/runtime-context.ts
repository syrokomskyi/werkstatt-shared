become active when RFC-0027 activates the Growth Layer.

 *   - `segment` — RESERVED. Always null at MVP. RFC-0027 will populate this from edge-runtime
 *                 persona detection. Content authors may write `visibility: { segment: "..." }`
 *                 today; the expression evaluates false until RFC-0027 activates it.
 *   - `flags`   — RESERVED. Always {} at MVP. RFC-0027 will populate this from feature-flag
 *                 edge evaluation. Content authors may write `visibility: { flag: "..." }` today;
 *                 the expression evaluates false until RFC-0027 activates it.
 *
 * `runtime.context.shape` verifies that no workspace code constructs a RuntimeContext
 * with non-null segment or non-empty flags before RFC-0027 supersedes this file.
